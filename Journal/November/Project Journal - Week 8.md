-	Week 8 (16th Nov â€“ 22nd Nov)

## **Tasks**
-	implement timestaps
-	Record in json format

## **Reflection**
-	Gained good understading for JSON and how JSON is used in python
-   Could have spend less time stuck on time fetures if i had reserched the lirarys better

## **reserch**

[Reading large JSON files in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10382253/reading-rather-large-json-files-in-python)
[Python JSON lib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - used for reading and wirting json
[python Time lib](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_date_time.htm) - for getting timestaps & calculating time

## **_Issues:_**

### **Software:**
-	Reading large JSON to slow

## **_Solutions_**

### **Software:**
-	found Library that uses streams and ararrys to speed up large pyhton reading
